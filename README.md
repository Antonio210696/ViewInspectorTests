# ViewInspectorTests

This repository has only learning purposes. It is used to provide sample projects to receive technical feedbacks. In the future, the repo may change name, project name, private or public state as I see fit.

The current project is a test of the `ViewInspector` testing framework for SwiftUI. What I try to do is to change a state variable (by pressing a button) and test that UI changes accordingly. As it is possible to see, I try to do it via `ViewInspector` but the test fails.

Thank you for your cooperation!
